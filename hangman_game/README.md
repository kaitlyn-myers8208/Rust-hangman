# Overview

This application is a console app written in Rust. It is a game of hangman that allows the user several guesses to guess a random word.

My purpose is to develop an understanding of the basic syntax and workings of Rust through creating a console program.

# Future Work

* Create cute graphic to display the man and incorrect guesses
* Display incorrect guesses
* Allow the user to pick the word and play with friends
